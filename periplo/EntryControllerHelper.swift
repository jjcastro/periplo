Welcome to Periplo, a crazy simple journaling app. To edit an entry, simply tap the ‚úèÔ∏è on the top right corner, then the üíæ to save. Press üíú to mark it as a favorite.\n\nYou may notice the editing mode looks a bit different. That's because Periplo uses **Markdown** to make text *pretty and useful*. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Tap ‚úèÔ∏è to see how it works:\n\n## Sub-heading\n### Another deeper heading\n \nParagraphs are separated\nby a blank line.\n\nTwo spaces at the end of a line leave a  \nline break.\n\nA [link](http://google.com).\n\nText attributes *italic*, **bold**.\n\nBullet list:\n* apples\n* oranges\n* pears", daysAgo: 3, isFavorite: true)

Without the pressure of this quantum memory foam strip malls would collapse.\n\nWe can see evidence of this when a pair is created such that one half is within the sales radius of a supermassive furniture store like Ikea-- one of them is pulled in and the other escapes as a Hawking mattress store.", daysAgo: 4, isFavorite: false)

As someone who is a scientist who studies puppers, doggos, yappers, and even woofers, I am telling you, specifically, in doggology, no one calls puppers doggos. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"doggo family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people \"call the small yip yip ones doggos?\" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. But that's not what you said. You said a pupper is a doggo, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the doggo family doggos, which means you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species doggos, too. Which you said you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?\n\n", daysAgo: 64, isFavorite: true)
